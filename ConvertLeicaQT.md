# ConvertLeicaQT — Desktop GUI for Leica LIF/XLEF/LOF

ConvertLeicaQT is a PyQt6 desktop application to browse Leica files, preview images quickly, and convert to OME‑TIFF using the same logic as the project’s CLI/server. It mirrors the web app’s behavior for progressive previews and disk caching, but runs locally as a native GUI.

## What it does

- Browse folders and Leica files (.lif, .xlef, .lof) with a left file tree.
- Inspect the structure of a selected Leica file in a right tree (folders/images), with lazy loading for nested XLEF structures.
- Show an image preview (center Z/T/tile) with progressive loading and disk caching.
- Display a compact, readable metadata summary and open the full JSON for folders or images.
- Convert the selected image to OME‑TIFF (or other formats depending on metadata) with a live log.
- Apply a size threshold rule during conversion (XY > threshold → OME‑TIFF; otherwise copy-through for LOF/XLEF).

## Key files and modules

- `ConvertLeicaQT.py` — This GUI.
- `CreatePreview.py` — Generates previews and manages the preview disk cache.
- `ci_leica_converters_helpers.py` — Reads Leica metadata (LIF/XLEF/LOF) and utilities.
- `leica_converter.py` — Conversion coordinator calling the concrete converters.
- `server.py` — Source of shared constants (preview steps, cache size) when available.
- `styles/darktheme.css` and `images/` — Styling and icons.

## UI layout

- Left: Folder/file tree (filters noisy items; when a folder has any .xlef, only .xlef files are shown in that folder).
- Right split:
  - Left: Leica file content tree (root → folders → images). Expands lazily; shows Folder JSON and Image JSON.
  - Right: Preview panel with a large image area, a short metadata summary, and a log.
- Bottom: Output folder picker, optional “Only convert LOF/XLEF with XY >” threshold, and a Convert button.

## Preview: progressive + cache (server parity)

- Steps: The GUI uses `server.PREVIEW_STEPS` when available (defaults to `[24, 112, 256]`).
- Cache dir: `%TEMP%/leica_preview_cache` (same as the server). Previews are cached as PNGs.
- Cache size: Uses `server.PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX` when available (default 500 files). Oldest items are evicted.
- Cache naming: `<UniqueID>_h<height>.png`. The code prefers `UniqueID`, then `uuid`, then `ImageUUID`. If none exist, it derives a stable-ish key from file path + dims.
- Generator: All previews go through `CreatePreview.create_preview_image(...)`, which:
  - Emits a cached file path if it already exists.
  - Otherwise generates via memory‑mapped reads when possible, adjusts contrast, writes to cache, and trims the cache.
- Small-image rule: If the image is ≤ 2048×2048, the GUI requests only the largest preview step.
- Skip smaller when largest cached: If the largest step image is already cached, the GUI skips requesting the smaller steps and immediately loads the largest.
- Diagnostics: The log prints “Preview [height]px: cache hit/miss” so you can verify cache usage.

## Image selection → which metadata is used?

- LIF: `get_image_metadata(folder_metadata, uuid)` returns the image block.
- XLEF: Merges the image node from the XLEF tree with the corresponding LOF‑like metadata (`get_image_metadata_LOF`). Preserves `save_child_name` if overwritten.
- LOF: Reads the LOF file’s metadata directly.

## Conversion flow

- Click “Convert selected image → OME‑TIFF”. Output goes to the chosen folder (defaults to `…/_c` near the file).
- The GUI spawns a worker that calls `leica_converter.convert_leica(...)` and streams `print()` output into the log.
- Rules (simplified):
  - LIF: If tilescan with `OverlapIsNegative`, create a single‑image `.lif`. Otherwise create OME‑TIFF (RGB vs multi‑channel handled by separate converters).
  - XLEF/LOF: If XY ≤ threshold (checkbox), return/copy original path; else convert to OME‑TIFF (RGB handled accordingly).
- The result dialog lists created paths; the log shows detailed progress.

## Configuration and defaults

- Initial root folder: If `server.ROOT_DIR` exists and is accessible, it’s used as the starting point. Otherwise the current working directory.
- Preview settings: Imported from `server.py` when present. Fallbacks inside the GUI:
  - `PREVIEW_STEPS`: `[24, 112, 256]`
  - `PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX`: `500`
- Style: `styles/darktheme.css` is applied if present; it references icons in `images/`.

## Performance notes

- Previews read only every Nth row (based on target height) and downscale via OpenCV; channels are colored by LUT names.
- Contrast is auto‑stretched using robust percentiles.
- Memory‑mapped slices avoid loading full volumes.
- Disk cache makes repeat previews near‑instant.

## Troubleshooting

- No cache hits: Ensure metadata includes a stable `UniqueID`/`uuid`/`ImageUUID`. If missing, the app derives a fallback key that may not be stable across different sources.
- Slow previews: Verify `opencv-python` and `numpy` are installed and hardware isn’t constrained. Large multi‑channel datasets will be slower on first render (cold cache).
- Empty trees: Some noise files/folders are filtered; ensure you double‑click a .lif/.xlef/.lof to populate the right content tree.
- Styling missing: Check `styles/darktheme.css` and that `images/` exists.

## Requirements

Core runtime for previews and conversion:

- numpy
- opencv-python
- pyvips
GUI runtime:

- PyQt6 (install if not already available)

## Running (example)

```bash
# Windows (cmd.exe) example
python ConvertLeicaQT.py
```

## FAQ

- Why do I sometimes see only one preview request?  
  If the image is ≤ 2048×2048 or the largest step is already cached, the app requests only the largest image.
- Where is the cache?  
  `%TEMP%/leica_preview_cache` (shared with the web server for parity).
- Can I clear the cache?  
  You can delete the cache folder. The app will recreate it on demand.
